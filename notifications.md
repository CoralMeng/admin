## Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}

If you are a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, as well as spending for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

Complete the following steps to set up email notifications for spending limits:
1. From the menu bar, click **Manage > Account > Notifications > Spending**. 
2. Enter a numeric value to set the threshold for triggering a specific type of spending notification:
    * Total account
    * Total runtime
    * Total services
    * Total container
    * Spending for a specific service
3. Click **Save**.

**Note**: If you have a trial account, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to set spending limits. For more information about Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, see [How you are charged](/docs/pricing/how_charged.html).
